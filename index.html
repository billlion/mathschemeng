<li> Here is a <a href="chen10072-week03-2017.txt">diary text file</a> of an Octave/Matlab session where I did a Newton's method example. It is a text fiel with the input and out put commands. Open it in a text editor then you can copy the commands in to a Matlab or Octave command window if you like.

<li> It looks like you might need a bit of help with integration! have a look at the  <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~cds/internal/tables/tables.html"> formula booklet</a> especially the table of integrals! Work throug the <a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/information-for-current-students/service-teaching/helm/">HELM modules</a> in Section 13 integration. You should be familiar with partial fractions, substitution and parts, and you should be able to look up common integals from the tables.
